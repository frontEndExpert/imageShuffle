# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. The project was to display 5 random images with titlw and description.
2. the title & description revealed by hovering on the image.
3. The 5 images can be shuffled to bring a new set of 5 random images that were not present before the last 2 shuffles.
